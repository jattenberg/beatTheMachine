The selective acquisition of example labels with the intent of building robust performance estimators at minimal cost is a topic getting recent attention in the research literature~\cite{activerisk2010,bennett:online}. However, while promising and potentially useful in practice, such acquisition strategies are focused on minimizing the cost required to compute a robust estimator for precision or total loss. In order to construct such an estimator, existing selective acquisition strategies sample from the problem space in accordance to some function of the output score of the model being considered. However, given a capable model deployed in a production system, it may take millions of samples from high-confidence positive predictions to reveal a single example that ``beats the machine.'' Incorporating performance bounds such as those presented in the referenced research with our proposed selection strategy is an interesting direction for future work.
